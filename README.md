# GameOffGithub

##Discalimer:

This repo is code only. We used many marketplace assets to make this game and due to Epic's license agreement we cannot push any marketplace assets directly on GitHub. You will have to fill everything out with your own meshes if you want to get the project working. Despite this, we believe everyone can still learn how our systems work by simply looking through the source code and the blueprint scripts. Happy coding!
